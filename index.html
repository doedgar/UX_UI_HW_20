                <p>My classmates and I were tasked with developing a mobile app that would solve everyday problems for
                    everyday people. We began by brainstorming problems that we all experience and eventually fell upon
                    baking. All four of us live in Colorado and have encountered struggles with either converting
                    recipes to high altitude or substituting ingredients due to allergies and dietary preferences.
                    Though there are some resources available online to help with this, we found there wasn't a
                    consolidated place where you could easily input an ingredient and receive a converted number back.
                    We also found that, in regards to substitutions, it is difficult to know which alternate ingredients
                    will be best suited for any given recipe. This gave us our starting point.</p>

            In order to narrow our focus, we created a survey using google forms to gauge what
            problems
            people experience most frequently while baking. The responses to two questions gave us insight into the
            problem
            we wanted to solve for our users. 100% of bakers make substitutions or modifications to baking recipes. The
            main reason bakers make these
            substitutions is due to high altitude
